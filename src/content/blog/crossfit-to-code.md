I opened Southeast CT CrossFit in 2007. I was 26, had no idea what I was doing, and convinced a bunch of people to pay me to make them do burpees at 6 AM.

Fast forward to today, and I'm running Shoreline Web Solutions, building custom websites and AI-powered tools for Connecticut businesses. On the surface, these businesses couldn't be more different. But the lessons? They're almost identical.

## Nobody Wants a Template

Here's the thing about CrossFit that people don't always get: the workouts are universal, but the execution is individual. Everyone does "Fran" – 21-15-9 thrusters and pull-ups – but your version of Fran looks different than mine. Maybe you're using a band for pull-ups. Maybe you're scaling the weight. The point is, you're getting what YOU need, not what some generic program assumes you need.

CrossFit is essentially open-source fitness. The methodology is published. The daily workouts are free online. Anyone can access the programming. But that's not what people pay for. They pay for coaching, for customization, for someone to look at their specific limitations and abilities and say "here's your version of this workout."

This is exactly why I don't build WordPress sites anymore.

When a client comes to me, they don't need a template with their logo swapped in. They need a solution built for their specific business, their customers, their goals. A restaurant in Old Saybrook doesn't have the same needs as an electrical contractor in Waterford. So why would I give them the same website?

I build everything custom. It takes longer. It costs more. But it works. Just like that scaled version of Fran works better than telling a 60-year-old grandmother to do the same workout as a 25-year-old former college athlete.

## You Don't Need Permission to Start

I didn't wait for the perfect gym space. I didn't wait until I had every piece of equipment. I started with a small space, some barbells, and a website I built myself (it was terrible, by the way).

My first few clients were friends who were willing to take a chance. We figured it out together. Some workouts were great. Some were disasters. But we kept showing up.

Same with Shoreline Web Solutions. My first websites weren't masterpieces. But they worked, and they got better with every project. My review response system, ReplyFast, started as a Python script I cobbled together because I was tired of manually checking Google reviews for clients. Now it's an actual product I'm selling.

You improve by doing, not by planning.

## Systems Free You Up to Care

In the gym, I created programming templates. Warm-up structure. Coaching progressions. Recovery protocols. This wasn't to make things robotic – it was to free up mental space so I could focus on what mattered: the person in front of me.

When you've got solid systems, you can actually be present. You're not scrambling to figure out what workout to do today. You're watching form, adjusting weights, having conversations.

Now I build systems for the same reason. ReplyFast automatically monitors Google Business Profile reviews and generates responses. Why? So my clients can focus on running their restaurants instead of obsessing over their Google notifications. The system handles the routine stuff. They handle the human stuff.

Good systems don't replace the personal touch. They protect it.

## Working ON It, Not Just IN It

This one took me way too long to learn.

At the gym, I was the guy who coached every class. Every single one. I'd be there at 6 AM, noon, and 6 PM. I was proud of it. Look how dedicated I am! Look how hard I'm working!

But I wasn't building a business. I was building myself a really demanding job.

There was no time to work on marketing. No time to develop new programs. No time to think strategically about growth. I was so busy coaching classes that I couldn't step back and actually run the business.

I'm watching myself fall into the same trap with Shoreline Web Solutions. It's so easy to say yes to every client project, to personally handle every website tweak, to jump on every support request. It feels productive. It feels necessary.

But if I'm always in the weeds writing code, who's building the business? Who's developing new products like ReplyFast? Who's creating the systems that let the business run without me?

The hardest lesson has been learning to say no to client work so I can say yes to business work. Building automation tools instead of doing manual work. Creating processes instead of being the process.

It's uncomfortable. It feels lazy at first. Shouldn't I be doing more?

But doing more IN the business isn't the same as doing what's right FOR the business. Sometimes the most important work is the work that doesn't feel like work – the planning, the strategizing, the system-building.

I'm still learning this one. Still catching myself spending entire weeks just executing client work instead of building the infrastructure that would make client work easier. But at least now I know what I'm supposed to be doing, even when I'm not doing it.

## Community Compounds

My best marketing for the gym was never Facebook ads or flyers. It was Sarah telling her coworker about her first pull-up. It was Mike bringing his buddy to try a class. People who got results became evangelists.

In my web business, it's the same. I'm active in Shoreline United Networking not because I'm hunting for leads, but because I genuinely believe in building relationships. Half my clients come from S.U.N. members who either hired me directly or referred someone who did.

Trust takes time. But once you've got it, it's self-sustaining. That restaurant owner tells another restaurant owner. That electrician recommends you to another contractor. Your network becomes your moat.

## Sell Outcomes, Not Features

Nobody joined my gym because they wanted to do Olympic lifts. They joined because they wanted to lose 30 pounds, or get off blood pressure medication, or keep up with their kids.

The barbell was just the tool.

Same with websites. Nobody wakes up thinking "I need a custom-coded site with responsive design and modern frameworks." They wake up thinking "I need more customers" or "My website makes me look unprofessional" or "I'm losing business to my competitor's better online presence."

The code is just the tool.

I learned this the hard way in the gym. When I talked about snatch technique and metabolic conditioning, people's eyes glazed over. When I talked about fitting into their wedding dress or playing with their grandkids without getting winded, they paid attention.

Now when I talk to clients, I lead with results. More leads. Better reviews. Professional image. The technical stuff comes later, if they ask.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

Both businesses taught me the same uncomfortable lesson: most people don't want what they need.

In the gym, people wanted abs. What they needed was to show up consistently for six months and fix their relationship with food.

In web development, people want a cheap, fast website. What they need is a strategic digital presence that actually converts visitors into customers.

The hard part isn't doing the work. The hard part is helping people understand what they actually need, and then trusting you enough to do it.

## What I'm Building Now

These days I'm at the intersection of all of it. I run Shoreline Web Solutions, building custom sites for shoreline businesses. I coordinate digital marketing for S.U.N., helping local businesses connect with each other. I'm even going back to teaching – working on my Connecticut teaching certification because I miss being in the classroom.

And I'm building ReplyFast, because I saw restaurants drowning in review management and thought "there has to be a better system for this."

All of it comes back to those early mornings in 2007, trying to convince people that they were stronger than they thought they were.

The business changed. The lesson didn't.
